Steam Workshop Collection Modlist Extractor

Hello! You've found my first project. 
This will be where I experiment with Python and Git
The goal will be a program that can convert a steam collection's mod ID numbers into a .csv file.
This can be used in dedicated server lists and online modlist webhooks.
