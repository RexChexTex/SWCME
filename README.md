The Steam Workshop Collection Modlist Extractor serves as a tool to hasten the deployment of game servers that utilize mods from the steam workshop.

Often, the server client will require the mods to be listed in a comma separated string, requiring cumbersome individual extraction.

This tool allows a user to input the id number of the workshop collection, which automaticaly parses the steam workshop and outputs a constructed .csv file for easy sharing of lists and deployments.
