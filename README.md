The Steam Workshop Collection Modlist Extractor serves as a tool to hasten the deployment of game servers that utilize mods from the steam workshop.
Often, the server client will require the mods to be listed in a comma separated string, requiring cumbersome individual extraction.

This tool allows a user to input the id number of the workshop collection, parse the steam workshop, and output a .csv file with a constructed string and matching .csv output file for easy sharing of lists and deployments.
